- cannot run docker from sshed bash shell: "-bash: docker: command not found"

- docker not supposed to be run from a VM as in https://docs.docker.com/desktop/vm-vdi/

- cannot run the docker swarm init --advertise-addr 192.168.137.3 from normal shell: "Error response from daemon: must 
  specify a listening address because the address to advertise is not recognized as a system address, and a system's IP 
  address to use could not be uniquely identified"

-  don't know how to see if docker image/container is actually running my python script or doing anything

- doesn't do anything for test case (see users/rache/sci_comp_special_core/cloud_comp/)
