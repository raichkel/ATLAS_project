- main_input will get the names of the files that need to be read and pass these to the workers
- each worker should read in the files and then pass them to main_output 
- main_output should take this data and execute the plotting code

main_output:
    image: /output/output
    build:
    context: ./
    dockerfile: ./ouput/Dockerfile
